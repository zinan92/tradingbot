## üéØ How to Start Trading Tomorrow

### Step 1: Setup Testnet (REQUIRED FIRST)
```bash
# Run the setup wizard
python scripts/setup_testnet.py

# This will:
# 1. Help you create a Binance testnet account
# 2. Get your API credentials
# 3. Test connectivity
# 4. Update your configuration
```

### Step 2: Start Paper Trading on Testnet
```bash
# Start with testnet (safe, no real money)
python scripts/start_live_trading.py --testnet

# Monitor the logs
tail -f logs/live_trading.log
```

### Step 3: Get Production API Keys (When Ready)
1. Go to [Binance API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)
2. Create new API key
3. Enable Futures trading
4. Set IP restrictions for security
5. Save API key and secret securely

### Step 4: Update Configuration
Edit `config/live_trading_config.yaml`:
```yaml
binance:
  production:
    api_key: "YOUR_REAL_API_KEY"
    api_secret: "YOUR_REAL_API_SECRET"

capital:
  initial_capital: 500  # Start with $500
```

### Step 5: Start Live Trading
```bash
# DANGER: Real money at risk!
python scripts/start_live_trading.py --production --confirm-production

# You'll need to type: "I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS"
```
