# Backtest Data Source Fixed - Now Using REAL Database Data

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Backtests Now Use Real Market Data

### What Was Fixed

1. **DataAdapter Configuration**
   - Changed from: `DataAdapter(None)` - which used mock data
   - Changed to: `DataAdapter({'host': 'localhost', 'database': 'tradingbot', ...})`
   - Updated `fetch_ohlcv` method to use `fetch_from_database` instead of `_generate_sample_data`

2. **Initial Capital Adjustment**
   - Bitcoin tests increased from $10,000 to $1,000,000
   - Required because backtesting.py doesn't support fractional trading
   - Bitcoin price around $116,000 requires larger capital

### Data Comparison: Mock vs Real

| Metric | Mock Data | Real Data |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Data Source** | Generated random walk | PostgreSQL database |
| **Price Range** | $86-$133 (unrealistic) | $108,566-$122,920 (actual BTC) |
| **Volatility** | ~0.00001 (too smooth) | 0.0009 (realistic) |
| **Data Points** | Generated on-demand | 520,577 BTCUSDT records |
| **Market Behavior** | Synthetic patterns | Real market dynamics |

### Real Data Backtest Results (Bitcoin EMA Crossing)

**With Real Market Data:**
- Initial Capital: $1,000,000
- Final Equity: $866,340
- Total Return: -13.37%
- Buy & Hold Return: +6.66%
- Total Trades: 152
- Win Rate: 19.74%
- Max Drawdown: -21.03%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.000

**Key Observations:**
- Strategy underperformed buy & hold (-13.37% vs +6.66%)
- Low win rate (19.74%) suggests strategy needs optimization
- Generated 152 trades over 30 days (realistic frequency)
- Results reflect actual market conditions and volatility

### Files Updated

1. `/scripts/backtesting_validation_tests.py`
   - DataAdapter now uses real database connection
   - Bitcoin tests use $1M initial capital

2. `/src/infrastructure/backtesting/data_adapter.py`
   - `fetch_ohlcv` now calls database instead of mock generator
   - Proper connection parameter handling

3. `/scripts/backtest_with_real_data.py`
   - Demonstrates real data usage
   - Shows actual Bitcoin prices from database

### Verification Script

Created `/scripts/verify_real_data_backtests.py` to confirm:
- ✅ Database contains 8,608 BTCUSDT records (last 30 days)
- ✅ Average price: $116,936 (realistic Bitcoin price)
- ✅ Data volatility: 0.0009 (natural market volatility)
- ✅ DataAdapter configured with database connection
- ✅ Fetched data matches database characteristics

### Next Steps

1. **Strategy Optimization**
   - Current EMA parameters (12/26) may not be optimal for 5m Bitcoin
   - Consider adjusting stop loss/take profit levels
   - Test different timeframes

2. **Performance Improvement**
   - Add trend filters to reduce false signals
   - Implement better risk management
   - Consider market regime detection

3. **Additional Testing**
   - Run all 10 scenarios with optimized parameters
   - Compare strategy performance across different assets
   - Validate against different market conditions

## Summary

The backtesting system is now **confirmed to be using real market data** from your PostgreSQL database. The previous issue where backtests were using mock data has been resolved. All future backtests will use actual historical market data, providing realistic and actionable results for strategy development and optimization.
